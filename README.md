# GOTM_LC

It is a modified version of General Ocean Turbulence Model (GOTM), which is built on version proposed by [Li et al. (2019)](https://doi.org/10.1029/2019MS001810).

An improved Second moment closure model for Langmuir turbulence conditions is incorporated into this modified version.

Input data pre-processing, model setup, and output data analysis and visualiztion are described with reference to [gotmwork](https://github.com/qingli411/gotmwork).
